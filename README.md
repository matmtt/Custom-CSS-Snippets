# Custom-CSS-Snippets 
This is a compilation of my CSS alterations of well known websites (or not).

I recommend using it alongside a extension like "Custom CSS by Denis", available at the Chrome Extension Webstore: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-css-by-denis/cemphncflepgmgfhcdegkbkekifodacd
